                    <h3>Government</h3>
                    <p>Members of the Ul Dynasty claim their sovereignty by right of birth. Their will is carried out by the Divan, a group of eight viziers who oversee matters of law, finance, engineering, the interior, commerce, war, religious affairs, and palace affairs. However the influence of the sultans has been waning for some time, and at the present true power is wielded by the Syndicate, a council sat by six of Ul’dah’s most elite and influential.</p>
